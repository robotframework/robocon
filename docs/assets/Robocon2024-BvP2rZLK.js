Discover how our attention to detail can shape a happier, more productive life. Join us to shift from bug-chasers to solution-creators, fostering collaboration and celebrating success.",Description:`Have you ever wondered how your career as a QA affects your life? We testers spend our time in detecting bugs, inconsistencies, and accessibility issues. We pay a lot of attention to details, try to think of scenarios not only on how to use the software, but how to abuse it too.  We are the gate-keepers for a new feature to be released. Is the new feature secure enough? Does it meet the requirements? We constantly seek for flaws and try negative scenarios. And by doing so, we become better and better at this. We train our eyes and our minds to see the flaws. In fact, we become too good at this. Our brain is a muscle; depending on the training we provide, the better we become at this.\r
\r
Have you ever considered how this training might affect the way we perceive the world in general outside the software?\r
All this negative thinking trains our brain to think negatively. And it does not stop when the clock ticks 5pm. This way of thinking, becomes the way we perceive the world around us. The way we interact with our colleagues, family or friends. The way we perceive challenges in life. Have you heard of the “Medical students' disease“? Is a condition frequently reported in medical students, who perceive themselves to be experiencing the symptoms of a disease that they are studying. The same happens to us, QA engineers, we constantly seek for flaws.\r
As Shawn Achor in the book “The Happiness advantage” said: “It’s not necessarily the reality that shapes us, but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality.”\r
\r
How about reversing all this negative thinking? How about instead of chasing bugs, we prevent bugs from happening by thinking more positively?\r
\r
If you can raise somebody’s level of positivity in the present, then their brain experiences a happiness advantage. Your intelligence, your creativity and your energy levels rise.\r
We can turn our issues into opportunities. When raising an issue or writing a review, we can provide constructive feedback. Instead of focusing on the result, we can focus on the process and how we can improve our Way-Of-Working. It does not matter how many tickets we raise. What does matter, are the discussions being raised by asking the right questions, firing up discussions, documenting, searching and providing actions.\r
Instead of testing the features being implemented by developers, think along with them while they develop; this way the product becomes more robust. We don’t need to measure success in numbers. Sometimes more is achieved by doing less. Give the space and the time to enable others to do more.\r
\r
We not only see the flaws but also the successes. We work closely with the developers and we see first the beautiful implementation they delivered, the solution they found, the way they handled a problem.

Efficient testing is a key success factor for fast and effective software development. We are facing the challenge of increasing test speed and repetition rate, as well as running tests in parallel. By running tests in the cloud, we are able to launch multiple solutions in different container instances in parallel, saving execution time. In combination with Jira as a test management tool and Jenkins as a starting point, we manage the test cases that will be executed and archive the results in an audit-compliant manner.

Easy test data management, data-driven testing even with various data items, fast and reliable test run preparation, human-readable keywords, and no need for dual script maintenance… – let us share our insights and tips!",Description:`Real-world projects serve as practical touchstones for theoretical concepts. Our current project, consisting of over 2500 lines of code and nearly 1000 lines of data, is still being developed. To ensure its sustainable growth without undue effort, we chose to adopt a meticulously structured approach.\r
\r
<br>\r
\r
Thankfully, Robot Framework, with its implementation of the keyword-driven testing concept, offers a wide variety of possibilities for structuring projects, be it the strict separation between human-readable test cases and their technically oriented implementations, importing data files in various formats, and the built-in differentiation of prerequisites of a test case and its implementation, to name the most useful ones.\r
\r
With its mentioned features in mind, we have successfully implemented several concepts and best practices in our project. Key among them are:\r
\r
* the strict separation of static test data from test scripts into YAML files (but still retaining randomness of values where needed), not only promoting data reusability across different tests;\r
* data-driven testing of similar scenarios notwithstanding different data items needed by them;\r
* utilizing queries to obtain dynamic test data from a database system, maximizing bug discovery possibilities;\r
* meeting the prerequisites of web tests through web services calls, vastly enhancing test preparation reliability and speed;\r
* carefully chosen keyword names and interfaces, each with a distinct purpose, leading to diminished demands on their documentation;\r
* a clear distinction between business keywords focused on human readability and technical keywords containing mainly implementation details; this, among others, enables people with limited technical backgrounds to assemble not only test cases but also some keywords.\r
\r
This last point is of significant importance as it allows for the export of only the human-readable portions of a script into an issue-tracking system. This, in turn, enables manual execution of the script whenever needed, eliminating the need for dual maintenance of manual scripts alongside Robot Framework's automated ones.\r
\r
We look forward to sharing our experiences, best practices, and tips for harnessing the full potential of not merely the highly structured approach inspired and enabled by Robot Framework's principles in a real-world project.

Discover how to use real-time network manipulation, empowering you with independence and flexibility in automation testing.",Description:`# Introduction\r
In an ideal world, testing is straightforward, with every aspect of the system easily testable, automation seamless, and testing scenarios requiring no adjustments. The reality often falls short of this ideal. Testing environments may lack vital resources, leading to a reliance on developers to create stubs and mocks or manual testing.\r
This dependence on developers can introduce bottlenecks and dependencies, especially when working under time constraints or with uncooperative teams. What if testers could gain more control and independence in their testing scenarios? Let's explore the concept of using Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) techniques to revolutionize software testing.\r
## The Pretend Game\r
Stubbing and mocking are established techniques in software testing. They involve manipulating specific parts of a test object to create specific testing scenarios. This is crucial when integration with external applications is impossible or when replicating desired behaviors is challenging.\r
However, challenges arise when it comes to automation and parallel testing, as toggling a stub or mock on and off simultaneously is impossible.\r
## Hacking your network: The MITM Approach\r
Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks are well-known in the cybersecurity domain for eavesdropping network communications. However, MITM techniques can be harnessed as a potent tool for software testing. This approach gives testers the ability to take control of their testing scenarios without relying on developers, external resources, or making changes to the application under test.\r
MITM offers several advantages:\r
### Real-time Network Manipulation\r
MITM allows testers to intercept and manipulate requests sent by applications, enabling the simulation of various scenarios. This can be done in parallel, by proxying a single browser instance to manipulate payloads, by delaying or even blocking specific endpoints.\r
### Backend Information Manipulation\r
MITM is a python library that provides testers with the ability to modify backend data, ensuring that the frontend displays the desired content for testing. Testers can use MITM to simulate various scenarios and verify how the application responds to different inputs. This powerful capability enhances test coverage and can help identify potential vulnerabilities faster¬.\r
## Versatility of MITM\r
One of the key strengths of MITM is its independence from the application under test. Testers can fully customize and utilize MITM according to their specific testing needs, without relying on external partners or introducing changes to the application's codebase. This versatility empowers testers to be more self-sufficient and flexible in their testing efforts.\r
## Conclusion\r
In an imperfect world, software testing can be a daunting task, with dependencies on developers and external resources. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) techniques provides testers with the independence and flexibility they need to overcome these challenges.`,Duration:20,"Slot Count":1,Language:"en","Session image":"","Speaker IDs":["T7EQ8T"],"Speaker names":["Mark Moberts"],Room:{en:"RoboConOnline"},Start:"2024-02-29T17:00:00+00:00",End:"2024-02-29T19:20:00+02:00","Lessons Learned":`How to use MITM with Robot Framework\r

Based on a practical solution, we examine if Robot Framework can unite both worlds",Description:`Traditionally, testing each release of a microcontroller's firmware involves flashing it onto the chip, integrating it into a HIL simulation and testing it in a closed loop. To move away from this time-consuming way of testing embedded firmware, embeff developed the ExecutionPlatform. The ExecutionPlatform allows you to perform open-loop tests on your microcontroller that operate at the pin level, but without performing an entire simulation of the environment (as in system testing). The test specifies a pin behavior or calls functions in the code. As a result, functions in the code are read or the activities on the pins are evaluated. \r
\r
These tests are written as Robot Framework scripts. They use Robot Keywords corresponding to the needed pins and endpoints the microcontroller sends and reads data from. After you have written your tests on your local machine, you can flash the firmware onto the chip and run the tests all via ethernet. \r
\r
As firmware becomes more complex and regulatory requirements come into play, a test management tool is required to define and organise the test cases and align them with the requirements and standards. The established TestBench tool provides a modular approach with pre-defined macros for building test cases. It is also possible to generate and export Robot Framework scripts. They can be executed and immediately imported back into the database with the corresponding test results. \r

Microwaving Robot Framework","Session type":{en:"Talk"},Track:null,Abstract:"Promoting re-usability and abstraction for a multi-interface telecommunication product. Employing one keyword per action offers consistent outputs across interfaces, versatile and reusable single-functionality tests and simplified user focus on keyword-based actions ensuring code simplicity.",Description:`Microwave backhaul is a method used in telecommunications to transmit data, voice and other signals through radio frequencies. Our portfolio includes hardware units with diverse functionalities that can be flexibly configured to create various network/radio topologies. In addition to this, all units support the following user access interfaces: webct (web page), snmp and ongoing integration of netconf, REST and cli. Testing should cover frontend, backend, and end-to-end functionalities for each hardware unit, spanning all interfaces and multiple topological setups. In order to mitigate these complexity issues, we introduced an approach to overload keywords with custom python annotations. In this talk, we'll explore hardware testing challenges as well as our framework structure.\r
The most significant principles in our framework are: <br>\r
\r
•	**One Keyword Approach**\r
Every action on our product is associated with a specific keyword that will apply it to the access interface given as input argument. Since multi-interfaces are supported, it is ensured that each keyword will return consistent outputs.<br>\r
\r
•	**Test Reusability Across Interfaces**\r
By extending the above principle from keyword-level to testcase-level, we achieve test uniformity across interfaces, saving development time and resources otherwise spent on separate test case creation.<br>\r
\r
•	**Test Adaptability Based on Network Topology**\r
Product functionality should be tested across different hardware units and different network topologies. Tests designed for one network topology can be adjusted to similar topologies. The system-under-test is described in a Python class variable file with each test dynamically loading network parameters from this file during runtime. Changing the python file, reuses the test to another hw unit and topology.<br>\r
\r
•	**User Experience Simplification and Code Readability**\r
To enhance user focus on keyword-driven actions, common interface actions are hidden by adding interface-related parameters as function arguments. Python decorators facilitate these principles by mapping system-dependent variables to their values and executing required actions for each interface.<br>\r
\r
•	**Extendable to new interfaces**<br>\r
Support for new user interfaces can be incorporated just by implementing the interface python functions and due to one-keyword approach and test adaptability, no new tests need to be re-written to test existing functionality!<br>`,Duration:30,"Slot Count":1,Language:"en","Session image":"","Speaker IDs":["VWUYL7"],"Speaker names":["Stavroula Ventoura"],Room:{en:"RoboCon"},Start:"2024-02-08T09:40:00+00:00",End:"2024-02-08T12:10:00+02:00","Lessons Learned":`What i have learned?\r

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.

We need data for almost every Analytical purpose. Financial institutions are one among the Major sectors using Data especially\r
in Trade and investment, Tax reform, Fraud detection and Investigation and Risk Analysis.\r
\r
We will have quick overview of a live use case and how we helped the client to tackle a real time problem by setting up an Automated Quality Controls process for Data Delivery to Analysis Teams.\r
\r
The Client had a problem statement of running 2000+ Database queries across 180+ DB tables across different Delivery checkpoints. This was manual, much time consuming and prone to manual error.\r
\r
The Data delivered to downstream systems was through different Business Layers, some in Hadoop, a few in Oracle and a few in files. I from Automation perspective saw the pattern of these queries and how we can simplify the whole process. I harnessed the power of Robot Framework and suggested to Automate the queries and we call it Data Quality Controls.\r
\r
We used Robot Framework and Automated 2000+ Controls and this serves as entry and exit checkpoints at each Business level. These Data Quality Controls run every month to ensure accuracy, completeness, consistency, validity and no wrong data is supplied to the DownStream system.\r
\r
Framework Architecture:\r
We build a Hybrid Test Automation Framework with Page Object Model, combined with Keyword and Data Driven Architecture to cater our needs.\r
\r
Tech Stack: Hadoop, HDFS, Oracle, Unix and Python\r
Test Automation: Robot Framework with Python\r
\r
Savings:\r
The Quality Control Validations which were previous performed by Business Users for weeks to months, got reduced to less than a Day's effort. We saved over 5000+ Person Days over the years.\r

This presentation will highlight how Amadeus revolutionized its test automation framework by moving from various internal test tools to a single Robot Framework ecosystem with functional keywords libraries based on python.`,Description:`[Amadeus](www.amadeus.com) is the world leader in software solutions for the travel industry and must deal with a complex environment including many technologies, ranging from industry standard to very business-specific ones. This can include technologies like Angular UIs, REST APIs, Soap XMLs, Kafka but also more specific airlines protocols like [EDIFACT](https://unece.org/trade/uncefact/introducing-unedifact) or Cryptic commands.\r
With its Amadeus pioneer mindset culture many new tools were internally developed to create test scripts libraries which keep on growing with the time. Addressing and maintaining all these libraries became, over time, a real challenge.\r
Moreover, building an end-to-end test solution with all these various tools turned out to be very complex and sometimes impossible, leading to a lot of manual test campaigns.\r
In this presentation we will show you how Robot Framework was a game changer for us as we started to automate in a much effective way, embracing the diversity of our technologies in a smooth way.\r
We will highlight:\r
- how by designing python library templates, we now have a common way of developing our business specific keywords libraries providing guidelines without affecting flexibility and without forcing users to a strict model,\r
- how our framework is based on standard keywords to send messages through the different protocols used for testing,\r
- how the defined templates are easily adaptable to small and large products,\r

RoboSAPiens provides a set of keywords for automating the SAP Windows GUI in a way that resembles commanding a person to use it. The key innovation is that only information visible in the user interface is needed. This is in stark contrast to existing solutions, which rely on the low-level structure of the GUI, resulting in cryptic automation scripts. In order to empower domain experts around the world, RoboSAPiens is designed to be translatable. Currently, keywords are available in English and German.\r
\r
This talk provides a short tutorial to get started using RoboSAPiens. After the installation and setup, different keywords will be showcased in a live demo. Along the way tips and tricks for automating the SAP GUI will be shared. There will also be some anecdotes from RoboSAPiens in the wild.\r

And if so, in what sense, in which areas, and to what extent? Let us take a closer look at the symbiosis of developers and test automation specialists and explore why keeping they roles separate is the key to unlocking the potential of a testing process.",Description:`In software development, the question of the developer's role in automated testing and that of the test automation specialist in development occasionally arises. We will take a thought-provoking look at this complex relationship in our talk.\r
\r
This question considers the overlap and similarities between their personalities and roles; however, differences do exist. While developers may possess the technical ability to create functional automated tests, test automation encompasses more than merely writing automatic tests, just as development involves more than coding an application. The skill sets of the two groups differ significantly: developers require extensive technical knowledge, while testers need to empathise with users or customers, understanding their needs and behaviour, business processes, and use cases. They require different mindsets: technically oriented versus customer-oriented, constructive versus critical, and synthetic versus analytical. (It is no coincidence that developers tend to focus on positive, happy-day scenarios, whereas testers usually discover negative ones.) \r
\r
It is therefore difficult to envisage a centaur, part tester and part developer, possessing these contrasting skills and mindsets. What is beyond imagination is this creature not being overwhelmed by its workload and receiving fair remuneration. However, the attitudes and skills of both developers and TA specialists are critical to the development of high-quality software, and thus not only performing tasks of the ones and the others but also maintaining a clear distinction between these two groups appears to be vital. Their collaboration is undoubtedly essential and, fortunately, also feasible as long as both parties strive to understand each other's inherently different personalities and attitudes while respecting each other's expertise. Their shared focus on a common goal and areas of their knowledge that overlap can also be immensely beneficial.\r

This presentation talks what benefits testing in production can bring to small open-source developer like me. Talk provides examples from my life as open-source developer and from projects like [Browser](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-browser) and [AssertionEngine](https://github.com/MarketSquare/AssertionEngine). Also presentation covers how those techniques can be applied to large scale enterprise applications.`,Duration:20,"Slot Count":1,Language:"en","Session image":"","Speaker IDs":["8HSX9A"],"Speaker names":["Tatu Aalto"],Room:{en:"RoboConOnline"},Start:"2024-02-29T13:30:00+00:00",End:"2024-02-29T15:50:00+02:00","Lessons Learned":"Many teams may just develop software and throw the software to a deployment and monitoring teams. If they do that, teams will miss lot of important feedback how their system work and what problems user may face.

Also testing in production is not same in testing in CI environment, but how/why CI system can be used to test in production.","Describe your intended audience":"Anyone who is interested to for being part of successful team.
