We testers spend our time in detecting bugs, inconsistencies, and accessibility issues. We pay a lot of attention to details, try to think of scenarios not only on how to use the software, but how to abuse it too.  We are the gate-keepers for a new feature to be released. Is the new feature secure enough? Does it meet the requirements? We constantly seek for flaws and try negative scenarios. And by doing so, we become better and better at this. We train our eyes and our minds to see the flaws. In fact, we become too good at this. Our brain is a muscle; depending on the training we provide, the better we become at this.\\r\\n\\r\\nHave you ever considered how this training might affect the way we perceive the world in general outside the software?\\r\\nAll this negative thinking trains our brain to think negatively. And it does not stop when the clock ticks 5pm. This way of thinking, becomes the way we perceive the world around us. The way we interact with our colleagues, family or friends. The way we perceive challenges in life. Have you heard of the “Medical students\' disease“? Is a condition frequently reported in medical students, who perceive themselves to be experiencing the symptoms of a disease that they are studying. The same happens to us, QA engineers, we constantly seek for flaws.\\r\\nAs Shawn Achor in the book “The Happiness advantage” said: “It’s not necessarily the reality that shapes us, but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHow about reversing all this negative thinking? How about instead of chasing bugs, we prevent bugs from happening by thinking more positively?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you can raise somebody’s level of positivity in the present, then their brain experiences a happiness advantage.

We don’t need to measure success in numbers. Sometimes more is achieved by doing less. Give the space and the time to enable others to do more.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe not only see the flaws but also the successes.

Our current project, consisting of over 2500 lines of code and nearly 1000 lines of data, is still being developed. To ensure its sustainable growth without undue effort, we chose to adopt a meticulously structured approach.\\r\\n\\r\\n<br>\\r\\n\\r\\nThankfully, Robot Framework, with its implementation of the keyword-driven testing concept, offers a wide variety of possibilities for structuring projects, be it the strict separation between human-readable test cases and their technically oriented implementations, importing data files in various formats, and the built-in differentiation of prerequisites of a test case and its implementation, to name the most useful ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith its mentioned features in mind, we have successfully implemented several concepts and best practices in our project. Key among them are:\\r\\n\\r\\n* the strict separation of static test data from test scripts into YAML files (but still retaining randomness of values where needed), not only promoting data reusability across different tests;\\r\\n* data-driven testing of similar scenarios notwithstanding different data items needed by them;\\r\\n* utilizing queries to obtain dynamic test data from a database system, maximizing bug discovery possibilities;\\r\\n* meeting the prerequisites of web tests through web services calls, vastly enhancing test preparation reliability and speed;\\r\\n* carefully chosen keyword names and interfaces, each with a distinct purpose, leading to diminished demands on their documentation;\\r\\n* a clear distinction between business keywords focused on human readability and technical keywords containing mainly implementation details; this, among others, enables people with limited technical backgrounds to assemble not only test cases but also some keywords.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis last point is of significant importance as it allows for the export of only the human-readable portions of a script into an issue-tracking system. This, in turn, enables manual execution of the script whenever needed, eliminating the need for dual maintenance of manual scripts alongside Robot Framework\'s automated ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe look forward to sharing our experiences, best practices, and tips for harnessing the full potential of not merely the highly structured approach inspired and enabled by Robot Framework\'s principles in a real-world project.

Discover how to use real-time network manipulation, empowering you with independence and flexibility in automation testing.","Description":"# Introduction\\r\\nIn an ideal world, testing is straightforward, with every aspect of the system easily testable, automation seamless, and testing scenarios requiring no adjustments. The reality often falls short of this ideal. Testing environments may lack vital resources, leading to a reliance on developers to create stubs and mocks or manual testing.\\r\\nThis dependence on developers can introduce bottlenecks and dependencies, especially when working under time constraints or with uncooperative teams. What if testers could gain more control and independence in their testing scenarios? Let\'s explore the concept of using Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) techniques to revolutionize software testing.\\r\\n## The Pretend Game\\r\\nStubbing and mocking are established techniques in software testing. They involve manipulating specific parts of a test object to create specific testing scenarios. This is crucial when integration with external applications is impossible or when replicating desired behaviors is challenging.\\r\\nHowever, challenges arise when it comes to automation and parallel testing, as toggling a stub or mock on and off simultaneously is impossible.\\r\\n## Hacking your network: The MITM Approach\\r\\nMan-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks are well-known in the cybersecurity domain for eavesdropping network communications. However, MITM techniques can be harnessed as a potent tool for software testing. This approach gives testers the ability to take control of their testing scenarios without relying on developers, external resources, or making changes to the application under test.\\r\\nMITM offers several advantages:\\r\\n### Real-time Network Manipulation\\r\\nMITM allows testers to intercept and manipulate requests sent by applications, enabling the simulation of various scenarios. This can be done in parallel, by proxying a single browser instance to manipulate payloads, by delaying or even blocking specific endpoints.\\r\\n### Backend Information Manipulation\\r\\nMITM is a python library that provides testers with the ability to modify backend data, ensuring that the frontend displays the desired content for testing. Testers can use MITM to simulate various scenarios and verify how the application responds to different inputs. This powerful capability enhances test coverage and can help identify potential vulnerabilities faster¬.\\r\\n## Versatility of MITM\\r\\nOne of the key strengths of MITM is its independence from the application under test. Testers can fully customize and utilize MITM according to their specific testing needs, without relying on external partners or introducing changes to the application\'s codebase. This versatility empowers testers to be more self-sufficient and flexible in their testing efforts.\\r\\n## Conclusion\\r\\nIn an imperfect world, software testing can be a daunting task, with dependencies on developers and external resources.

To move away from this time-consuming way of testing embedded firmware, embeff developed the ExecutionPlatform. The ExecutionPlatform allows you to perform open-loop tests on your microcontroller that operate at the pin level, but without performing an entire simulation of the environment (as in system testing). The test specifies a pin behavior or calls functions in the code. As a result, functions in the code are read or the activities on the pins are evaluated. \\r\\n\\r\\nThese tests are written as Robot Framework scripts. They use Robot Keywords corresponding to the needed pins and endpoints the microcontroller sends and reads data from. After you have written your tests on your local machine, you can flash the firmware onto the chip and run the tests all via ethernet. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs firmware becomes more complex and regulatory requirements come into play, a test management tool is required to define and organise the test cases and align them with the requirements and standards. The established TestBench tool provides a modular approach with pre-defined macros for building test cases. It is also possible to generate and export Robot Framework scripts. They can be executed and immediately imported back into the database with the corresponding test results. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis can now be taken a step further with the ability to access, export and execute tests via a REST API call to the TestBench server.

Testing should cover frontend, backend, and end-to-end functionalities for each hardware unit, spanning all interfaces and multiple topological setups. In order to mitigate these complexity issues, we introduced an approach to overload keywords with custom python annotations. In this talk, we\'ll explore hardware testing challenges as well as our framework structure.\\r\\nThe most significant principles in our framework are: <br>\\r\\n\\r\\n•\\t**One Keyword Approach**\\r\\nEvery action on our product is associated with a specific keyword that will apply it to the access interface given as input argument. Since multi-interfaces are supported, it is ensured that each keyword will return consistent outputs.<br>\\r\\n\\r\\n•\\t**Test Reusability Across Interfaces**\\r\\nBy extending the above principle from keyword-level to testcase-level, we achieve test uniformity across interfaces, saving development time and resources otherwise spent on separate test case creation.<br>\\r\\n\\r\\n•\\t**Test Adaptability Based on Network Topology**\\r\\nProduct functionality should be tested across different hardware units and different network topologies. Tests designed for one network topology can be adjusted to similar topologies. The system-under-test is described in a Python class variable file with each test dynamically loading network parameters from this file during runtime. Changing the python file, reuses the test to another hw unit and topology.<br>\\r\\n\\r\\n•\\t**User Experience Simplification and Code Readability**\\r\\nTo enhance user focus on keyword-driven actions, common interface actions are hidden by adding interface-related parameters as function arguments. Python decorators facilitate these principles by mapping system-dependent variables to their values and executing required actions for each interface.<br>\\r\\n\\r\\n•\\t**Extendable to new interfaces**<br>\\r\\nSupport for new user interfaces can be incorporated just by implementing the interface python functions and due to one-keyword approach and test adaptability, no new tests need to be re-written to test existing functionality!<br>","Duration":30,"Slot Count":1,"Session image":"","Speaker IDs":["VWUYL7"],"Speaker names":["Stavroula Ventoura"],"Room":{"en":"RoboCon"},"Start":"2024-02-08T09:40:00+00:00","End":"2024-02-08T12:10:00+02:00","Lessons Learned":"What i have learned?\\r\\n* how to use decorators for custom keywords . \\r\\n* how to test actual hw, and how sensitive it is\\r\\n*  how hard it is to combine different interfaces\\r\\n*  how to automate also peripheral units (instruments needed for our tests)\\r\\n* how to reuse code of the two existing frameworks to unite to one\\r\\n* how to make the framework user-friendly and appealing to all testers - automated and manual - and clear to all, despite their automation knowledge. \\r\\n* how to continuously improve the user-experience and the framework capabilities.","Describe your intended audience":null,"Is this suitable for ..?":"Beginner RF user, Intermediate RF user, Advanced RF user"},{"ID":"EJTPFY","Proposal title":"Automated Generation of Acceptance Tests of Process-Aware Information Systems (PAIS)","Session type":{"en":"PreRecorded-Talk"},"Track":null,"Abstract":"Test coverage in customizable PAIS can be challenging due to complexity and variability of process models.

We will take a thought-provoking look at this complex relationship in our talk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis question considers the overlap and similarities between their personalities and roles; however, differences do exist. While developers may possess the technical ability to create functional automated tests, test automation encompasses more than merely writing automatic tests, just as development involves more than coding an application. The skill sets of the two groups differ significantly: developers require extensive technical knowledge, while testers need to empathise with users or customers, understanding their needs and behaviour, business processes, and use cases. They require different mindsets: technically oriented versus customer-oriented, constructive versus critical, and synthetic versus analytical. (It is no coincidence that developers tend to focus on positive, happy-day scenarios, whereas testers usually discover negative ones.) \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is therefore difficult to envisage a centaur, part tester and part developer, possessing these contrasting skills and mindsets.

Their collaboration is undoubtedly essential and, fortunately, also feasible as long as both parties strive to understand each other\'s inherently different personalities and attitudes while respecting each other\'s expertise.

Aufgrund der hohen Kosten und des Funktions-Overkills kommerzieller Lösungen und unserer guten Erfahrungen mit Robot Framework entschieden wir uns, eine Bibliothek für visuelle Dokumententests zu erstellen. Visuelle Tests bedeuten: Das Testdokument wird gerendert und pixelweise mit einem Referenzdokument verglichen. Wir haben jedoch festgestellt, dass dies nicht ausreicht.\n\nWir wollten Berichte mit Screenshots haben, die die verschiedenen Bereiche hervorheben. Wir wollten Bereiche aus dem Vergleich ausschließen, die auf Koordinaten oder Textmustern basieren. Wir wollten Strichcodes lesen können. Wir wollten akzeptable Bereiche für verschobene Textblöcke definieren. Wir wollten Textinhalte aus einer PDF-Datei oder über OCR vergleichen.

It can be used for test automation and robotic process automation (RPA).\n\nRobot Framework is supported by Robot Framework Foundation. Many industry-leading companies use the tool in their software development.\nRobot Framework is open and extensible. Robot Framework can be integrated with virtually any other tool to create powerful and flexible automation solutions.
