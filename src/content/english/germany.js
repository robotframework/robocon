    body: `<p>This fall, RoboCon will be a guest at the <span class="color-theme">Software QS-Tag in Frankfurt</span>.</p>
      <p>For the first time, we will have the opportunity to host a one-day RoboCon at the heart of Europe.
      RoboCon will share a conference building with the Software QS-Tag and the exchange with the visitors of
      the QS-Tag will hopefully lead to interesting discussions.</p>
      <p>As a visitor with a RoboCon ticket, only the RoboCon track is available.
      If you would like to attend RoboCon and the QS-Tag on both days (5 & 6 October),
      including an overnight stay in the conference hotel, please book a ticket for the Software QS-Tag at
      <a href="https://qs-tag.de">qs-tag.de</a></p>
      <p>We look forward to seeing you!</p>`
