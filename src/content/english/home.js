    <h3>We are happy to announce that RoboCon 2023 is coming.</h3>
    <p>This time we are going to have <span class="color-theme">two conferences</span>. First conference is <span class="color-theme">fully in-person in Helsinki</span>, where all the talks and other content will be live in Bio Rex in <span class="color-theme">week 3 in January!</span></p>
    <p>The <span class="color-theme">online conference</span> will take place in <span class="color-theme">week 9</span> with fully online content. We will record the talks in Helsinki but will also have at least 50% fresh content.</p>
    <p>The Helsinki ticket will include the online ticket as well. This arrangement enables us to fully engage with people first onsite and then online. This way we can have the best of both worlds and truly bring people together.</p>
    <p>For the online conference we will most likely have the amazing video-game like Gather.Town platform and Joe Colantonio as our host!</p>
    <h3>CFP</h3>
    <p>We are opening the CFP soon. Please submit your talk proposal in a timely manner.</p>
    <p>For onsite speakers, we will compensate travel costs up-to 500â‚¬ on top of the free conference ticket with a backstage pass.</p>
    <p>Also online speakers will get the free online conference tickets and if needed we will compensate for proper audio equipment for the speakers.</p>
