For Robot Framework test and task suite authors, JupyterLab\'s user-friendly authoring environment provides a new fun way to learn, practice and even share Robot Framework. JupyterLab encourages fast iterations and learning by discovering, and <a href="https://youtu.be/-gU4srzslpc">our dedicated SeleniumLibrary support with &quot;sticky session&quot;</a> makes it an extremely productive for testing and automating with web browsers. At least for small projects, JupyterLab can replace traditional test and tasksuite authoring tools.</p><p>We welcome all level of Robot Framework users to our workshop. At our workshop, beginners will learn the very basics of Robot Framework for browser testing and automation in a new and fun way. Advanced Robot Framework users may not learn much new about Robot Framework, but will get a new open source tool into their toolbox from JupyterLab.</p><p>This is a hands-on workshops for maximum of 12 participants. Asko is native in Finnish and Nick in English. Own laptop is required with permissions to install new software. We provide a "single click installer" for the JupyterLab environment used in the workshop for Windows, MacOS and Linux. Installing JupyterLab with the installer is part of the workshop. The installation  provides uninstaller for Windows and single removable directory for MacOS and Linux.</p><p>In this workshop we cover:</p><ul><li>installing JupyterLab with Robot Framework integration</li><li>walkthrough JupyterLab IDE features for Robot Framework</li><li>authoring and executing Robot notebooks with JupyterLab</li><li>authoring and using custom keyword libraries with JupyterLab</li><li>authoring and using Python keyword libraries with JupyterLab</li><li>advanced features of our Robot Framework Jupyter integrations</li><li>writing inline documentation into notebooks in JupyterLab</li><li>executing Robot notebooks from command line</li><li>exporting Robot notebooks into .robot-files</li><li>highlights of the current JupyterLab extension ecosystem</li></ul><p>JupyterLab is being developed and maintained by <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Project Jupyter</a> and its large community. The hosts of this workshop are the authors of Robot Framework support for Jupyter environments, including JupyterLab. 100% of the registration fees for this workshop will be used to cover the costs and support the Robot Framework foundation.</p><p>Participants should bring their own laptop with Windows, OSX or Linux. Local admin rights are also needed for JupyterLab installations.</p>',
                  bio:
                    "<p>Asko, an established Robot ecosystem contributor, bootstrapped the work on Robot support for interactive computing in Jupyter at the sprints of RoboCon 2018, and continues to explore new ways to ease test and task authoring with Jupyter. Asko works as a Systems Designer at Digital Services of University of Jyväskylä, where Robot Framework is used for both acceptance testing and process automation.</p><p>Nick, while a newcomer to the Robot ecosystem, is a long-time contributor to many Jupyter, Python, and JavaScript projects, bringing skills and knowledge to integrate Robot across many parts of the Jupyter ecosystem and beyond. Nick works at the Georgia Tech Research Institute as a Systems Architect, while also providing code, design and architecture contributions as a Jupyter Project core team member and local Jupyter User Group organizer.</p>",
