                  description: "Document Testing in the digital age - is that really a thing? Yes, it is. Because paperless does not mean documentless. Let me show you how we test our documents and printer files visually and by their content - using Robot Framework and our own Visual Document Testing Library.",
                  descriptionExpanded: "<p>Companies rely on correct documents. For us as a global freight forwarder, correct documents are essential. A silly mistake in a document could be awkward – but it might also have legal consequences. Documents in freight forwarding can transfer the ownership of goods from party A to party B. They confirm if cargo has properly been x-rayed for security purposes. They might be barcode labels to identify a package.</p><p>When a major upgrade of our Output & Document Management System was planned, we had to ensure that our documents look the same as before the upgrade. Given the high number of document types, formats, variants, and rules per documents, we quickly realized that we cannot do that manually.</p><p>So, the question was: Buy or build? Due to the high cost and feature overkill of commercial solutions and our good experience with Robot Framework we decided to build a library for Visual Document Tests. Visual Tests mean: The test document is rendered and compared pixelwise to a reference document. However, we realized that this is not enough.</p><p>We wanted to have reports with screenshots highlighting the different areas. We wanted to ignore areas from the comparison based on coordinates or text patterns. We wanted to read barcodes. We wanted to define acceptable ranges for moved text blocks. We wanted to compare text content from a PDF or via OCR. We wanted to check additional data like digital signatures. We wanted to interpret and compare printer files like postscript and pcl. We wanted to have a simple GUI to evaluate the test results. The result was a Robot Framework Library purely based on open source components offering features which can only be found in expensive commercial solutions.</p>",
                  bio: "<p>My name is Many and I work as a Test Manager at Schenker AG (in Germany/Essen) in the Technology Solution Center. Even though I like all aspects of testing - somehow I ended up focusing on the implentation of Test Automation Solutions in different projects. I love my field of work, as the technology around me is changing constantly. And there's always something new to learn. I did my first Kubernetes Deployment recently, and I felt like a little boy starting his C64 for the first time.</p><p>Before I was a father, I liked to play a lot of computer games and played the guitar. But currently my Steam Library is just growing and the guitar is catching dust. On vacations I like to go hiking and just enjoy nature (and a cold beer). Beside that, I (still) like Star Wars and always correct people who say that it is Science Fiction (as it is clearly Science Fantasy).</p>",

The presentation is a mini-tutorial that you can either just watch or, if you are interested, follow hands-on so that you create the same library yourself.

                  description: "Two decades ago, software development looked very different than it does today. Supposed “best practices” involved document-heavy processes that divided work into phases with testing at the end and performed by a separate QA function that did supposedly “independent” verification and validation. The most commonly used test automation tools of the day were from commercial vendors who mostly sold to executives on the promise of making test automation “easy” through record and playback. This was desirable because the QA group was often so removed from the development effort that they had no access to the source code, and often did not have coding skills. So vendors sold supposedly magic solutions that generally turned out to be hugely expensive with very little return. The frustration, pain, and failures stemming from heavyweight phased software development processes gave rise to Agile. At the same time the frustration and pain stemming from specialized test automation tools that often didn’t play nicely with source control gave rise to a new generation of open source test automation tools. The short lived Agile Alliance program, “AAFTT” became for a very brief time in history a gathering place for people working on this new generation of tools, of which Robot Framework is one. In this talk, we’ll look at the history of test automation tools and why Robot Framework was -- and is -- so successful.",

                    After the main conference we have development sprints. Sprints are for you if you
                    want to contribute to some existing project in Robot Framework ecosystem, have a project or project idea you'd
                    like to work with others, or just want to meet with other Robot Framework users and developers. We'll also have
                    sauna afterwards!<br>
                    <br>
                    Developers will select tasks suitable for new contributors beforehand (typically
                    labeled with <code>good first issue</code> or <code>help wanted</code> in their issue trackers), but participants
                    can obviously select issues they’d like to work with themselves. Many of the tasks are likely to involve coding,
                    but there certainly are also non-coding tasks like testing, documentation and work with infrastructure like CI.
                </p>
                <p>If you are new to contributing to open source, we recommend you to take a look at the
                  <a target='blank' href='https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/'>How to Contribute to Open Source</a>
                    guide. Individual
                    projects typically also have their own contribution guidelines you can find via their project pages and may want
                    to study beforehand.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Sprints are free of charge and open for everyone</b>, including those not participating
                    the conference itself. Sprint facilities are provided by Robot Framework Foundation.

During the second half you will get familiar with other extending and integration possibilities such as the listener API, parsing API, modifying tests dynamically before execution, starting execution programmatically and analyzing results.</p><p>This workshop is for you if you already know basics of using Robot Framework, including basics of writing tests libraries, and want to take your skills to the next level. These skills make it easier to adapt the framework to your own needs in different contexts.</p><p>The workshop is 100% hands-on, no slides, learn-by-doing. In addition to learning from the person who has designed these powerful APIs, you have a change to ask hard questions related Robot Framework from its creator.</p>",

If you have a project to be added to the list, send an email to info@robocon.io or simply come to the sprints and present your project there.<br><br>- <a target='blank' href='https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework'>Robot Framework</a><br>- <a target='blank' href='https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary/'>SeleniumLibrary</a><br>- <a target='blank' href='https://robots-from-jupyter.github.io/'>RobotLab</a><br>- <a target='blank' href='https://github.com/Snooz82/robotframework-datadriver'>DataDriver</a><br>- <a target='blank' href='https://github.com/Omenia/robotframework-whitelibrary'>WhiteLibary</a><br>- <a target='blank' href='https://robotframework.org/MavenPlugin/'>MavenPlugin</a> and other Java tooling<br>- <a target='blank' href='https://github.com/bulkan/robotframework-requests'>RequestsLibrary</a><br><br>Project maintainers are advised to add common <code>good first issue</code> and <code>help wanted</code> labels to issues they believe are good for new contributors and to issues they'd especially like someone to help with, respectively. Participants can use these labels to find suitable issues for them, but they are obviously free to work with anything they feel interesting. Many of the tasks are likely to involve coding, but there certainly are also non-coding tasks like testing, documentation and work with infrastructure like CI.</p> <p>If you are new to contributing to open source, we recommend you to take a look at the <a target='blank' href='https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/'>How to Contribute to Open Source</a> guide. Individual projects typically also have their own contribution guidelines that you can find via their project pages. We'll also have a dedicated session for new contributors at the sprints.<br><br><p><h3 class='mb-0 mt-4'>ROUGH AGENDA:</h3></p><p>10:00 - Welcome! Introduction to participating projects and tasks they have available.</p> <p>10:30 - Development! Participants can work with tasks they find interesting either alone, in pairs, or in small groups. Project leaders help as much as they can.</p><p>10:30 - Introduction to contributing to open source session for interested new contributors.</p><p>12:30 - Lunch (most likely pizza).</p><p>15:30 - Presenting what has been accomplished.</p> <p>16:00 -  Official program ends. Sauna opens. Coding can continue.</p></div>"
