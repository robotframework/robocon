It will bring new development efforts to the tool, benefitting also test automation work in the process.

We are able to run RF regression testing on a per build basis with testing coverage of 85%.  RF regression testing is able to be completed in a less than 3 hours.<br><br>Using Jenkins pipeline we are able to run all RF testing in parallel across any number of nodes.  Currently, we do not do the same testing on each of the devices but instead to get more coverage quickly we use tags to split the tests into equal sizes across the devices under test.  This allows us to balance hardware needs while holding to an acceptable feedback time for developers.

Such duality is challenging regarding the evaluation of a tool and comparison with other tools, as the quality of a related library is the responsibility of an individual project, independent of the core-tool.

During the second half you will get familiar with other extending and integration possibilities such as the listener API, variable files, modifying tests dynamically before execution, starting execution programmatically and analyzing results.</p><p>This workshop is for you if you already know basics of using Robot Framework, possibly also basics of writing tests libraries, and want to take your skills to the next level. The workshop is 100% hands-on, no slides, learn-by-doing, and there should be something new for even experienced Robot Framework users. In addition to learning about these powerful extension APIs, you have a chance to ask hard questions related to Robot Framework from its creator. </p><p>Extending Robot Framework means coding, and participants should thus know the basics of Python programming. You should bring your own laptop with Python 3.6 or newer and Robot Framework 3.1 or newer installed. You should also have adequate admin rights to install possible additional Python modules using pip. An editor for writing Python code and Robot Framework tests is needed as well.</p>",

We'll also have sauna afterwards!</p><p>Confirmed project represented in the sprints (send email to <a href='mailto:info&#64;robocon.io'>info&#64;robocon.io</a> to add yours):</p><ul style='text-align: left; width: 100%'><li><a href='https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework'>Robot Framework</a> (Pekka Klärck)</li><li><a href='https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary'>SeleniumLibrary</a> (Tatu Aalto)</li><li><a href='https://github.com/robots-from-jupyter/robotkernel'>Jupyter plugin</a> (Asko Soukka and Nick Bollweg)</li><li><a href='https://github.com/Omenia/robotframework-whitelibrary'>WhiteLibrary</a> (Ismo Aro and Eeva Terkki)</li></ul><p>Developers from the aforementioned projects will select tasks suitable for new contributors beforehand (typically labeled with <tt>good new issue</tt> or <tt>help wanted</tt> in their issue trackers), but participants can obviously select issues they’d like to work with themselves. Many of the tasks are likely to involve coding, but there certainly are also non-coding tasks like testing, documentation and work with infrastructure like CI.</p> <p>If you are new to contributing to open source, we recommend you to take a look at the <a href='https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/'>How to Contribute to Open Source</a> guide. Individual projects typically also have their own contribution guidelines you can find via their project pages and may want to study beforehand.</p> <p>Agenda:<br></p><p>10:00 - Welcome! Introduction to participating projects and tasks they have available.</p> <p>10:30 - Development! Participants can work with tasks they find interesting either alone, in pairs, or in small groups. Project leaders help as much as they can.</p> <p>15:30 - Presenting what has been accomplished.</p> <p>16:00 -  Official program ends. Sauna opens. Coding can continue.</p> <p>Sprints are free of charge and open for everyone, including those not participating the conference itself. Sprint facilities are provided by Eficode.
