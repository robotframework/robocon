In this keynote we are going to take a look at what's happened since RoboCon 2020. Ismo will first give an update related to Robot Framework Foundation, the consortium sponsoring Robot Framework development and also organizing this event. After that Pekka will talk about cool new features in Robot Framework 4.0 as well as what has been happening in the wider Robot Framework ecosystem. After looking at the past and present, we'll talk about the plans for the future.",

                  description: "In Roboland, an ugly code is a crime. It makes people sad, creates bugs, is slower to read and harder to understand. Nobody wants to go to jail, especially unintentionally. Fortunately, there are heroes who can protect innocent citizens from this threat - their names are Robocop and Robotidy.",
                  descriptionExpanded: "This talk is concentrated around concept of writing a clean, beautiful and easy to read code in Robot Framework. During the presentation we will present 2 new tools that can help developers and testers to easily write, maintain and refactor the code. Both tools are configurable which makes them perfect for use in projects where coding guidelines are present but also for the ones where they are going to be established. Robocop and Robotidy are the heroes nobody asked for but everyone needed.",
                  bio: "There is no day where I don't think about how we can do better. The space for improvements is bigger than we think. I believe that the quality of work inside the company is as important as the quality of end-product. I try to enhance the productivity inside the teams as a way to achieve customer's satisfaction.<br><br>I have spent 5 years on automation including 3 on Robot Framework and now I feel I can give something back to the community. I really want to share with you my tips on how to write beautifully in Robot Framework. I also started contributing in open-source projects and RoboCop (which I am a co-author of) is the one I will be concentrating during the talk. See you!",

                  title: "Print is (not) dead – Visual Document Testing using Robot Framework",
                  description: "Document Testing in the digital age - is that really a thing? Yes, it is. Because paperless does not mean documentless. Let me show you how we test our documents and printer files visually and by their content - using Robot Framework and our own Visual Document Testing Library.",
                  descriptionExpanded: "<p>Companies rely on correct documents. For us as a global freight forwarder, correct documents are essential. A silly mistake in a document could be awkward – but it might also have legal consequences. Documents in freight forwarding can transfer the ownership of goods from party A to party B. They confirm if cargo has properly been x-rayed for security purposes. They might be barcode labels to identify a package.</p><p>When a major upgrade of our Output & Document Management System was planned, we had to ensure that our documents look the same as before the upgrade. Given the high number of document types, formats, variants, and rules per documents, we quickly realized that we cannot do that manually.</p><p>So, the question was: Buy or build? Due to the high cost and feature overkill of commercial solutions and our good experience with Robot Framework we decided to build a library for Visual Document Tests. Visual Tests mean: The test document is rendered and compared pixelwise to a reference document. However, we realized that this is not enough.</p><p>We wanted to have reports with screenshots highlighting the different areas. We wanted to ignore areas from the comparison based on coordinates or text patterns. We wanted to read barcodes. We wanted to define acceptable ranges for moved text blocks. We wanted to compare text content from a PDF or via OCR. We wanted to check additional data like digital signatures. We wanted to interpret and compare printer files like postscript and pcl. We wanted to have a simple GUI to evaluate the test results. The result was a Robot Framework Library purely based on open source components offering features which can only be found in expensive commercial solutions.</p>",
                  bio: "<p>My name is Many and I work as a Test Manager at Schenker AG (in Germany/Essen) in the Technology Solution Center. Even though I like all aspects of testing - somehow I ended up focusing on the implentation of Test Automation Solutions in different projects. I love my field of work, as the technology around me is changing constantly. And there's always something new to learn. I did my first Kubernetes Deployment recently, and I felt like a little boy starting his C64 for the first time.</p><p>Before I was a father, I liked to play a lot of computer games and played the guitar. But currently my Steam Library is just growing and the guitar is catching dust. On vacations I like to go hiking and just enjoy nature (and a cold beer). Beside that, I (still) like Star Wars and always correct people who say that it is Science Fiction (as it is clearly Science Fantasy).</p>",

                  description: "Two decades ago, software development looked very different than it does today. Supposed “best practices” involved document-heavy processes that divided work into phases with testing at the end and performed by a separate QA function that did supposedly “independent” verification and validation. The most commonly used test automation tools of the day were from commercial vendors who mostly sold to executives on the promise of making test automation “easy” through record and playback. This was desirable because the QA group was often so removed from the development effort that they had no access to the source code, and often did not have coding skills. So vendors sold supposedly magic solutions that generally turned out to be hugely expensive with very little return. The frustration, pain, and failures stemming from heavyweight phased software development processes gave rise to Agile. At the same time the frustration and pain stemming from specialized test automation tools that often didn’t play nicely with source control gave rise to a new generation of open source test automation tools. The short lived Agile Alliance program, “AAFTT” became for a very brief time in history a gathering place for people working on this new generation of tools, of which Robot Framework is one. In this talk, we’ll look at the history of test automation tools and why Robot Framework was -- and is -- so successful.",

                    <h3>Checklist to follow before you start recording</h3>
                  <p class="type-body">
                    • When possible record with your monitor resolution set at 1280 x 720. All videos (both slides and demos) must be recorded in the following resolution: 1280 x 720. It is important for video quality that you record at 1280 x 720 and not a higher 16:9 resolution (even if you are using a Retina display).<br>
                    • Use the <a style="white-space: nowrap;"href="${require('./assets/template/RoboCon2021_Templ.potx')}">RoboCon Slide Template</a><br>
                    • Remember that some viewers will be watching the conference on devices like tablets, phones, etc. We want your text to be legible on all devices. We recommend increasing font size on all IDEs, text editors, and command line to at least 16.<br>
                    • Disable system and application notification pop-ups<br>
                    • Make sure if you’re using a laptop that it is plugged in<br>
                    • Make sure your camera is stable and not shaky<br>
                    • Meet audio requirements listed below (DO NOT USE YOUR INTERNAL MICROPHONE)<br>
                    • Close email, Skype, IM, browsers, or anything else that may interrupt you<br>
                    • Turn off fans, A/C, other computers/servers in your recording room, or anything else that might “click on” and create background noise while recording<br>
                    • Clean up your desktop and taskbar<br><br>
                  </p>
                  <h3>RoboCon Conference Format</h3>
                  <p class="type-body">
                    So what should a RoboCon session video look like?
                    First sessions should be user-based – not vendor sales pitches. Videos that are skewed towards a vendor sales pitch will not be accepted!<br><br>
                    • The first few minutes are just you talking to the camera about what you are about to show us.<br>
                    • Screen share showing the use of a tool, technique or tip that will help us in our day-to-day testing efforts (you don’t need to have your camera turned on during this part if you don’t want to but it is always nice to see the speaker. We recommend to have a Picture in Picture at the lower right corner).<br>
                    • Also, since the videos are pre-recorded, speakers are encouraged to dive into the actual code to “show us,” not just “tell us” how something can be achieved. This is what will set us apart from a “live,” in person conference — more in-depth with real, hands-on, screen-sharing-type demos. Once again this varies depending on your topic.<br>
                    • The last minute should just be you on camera wrapping up your session.<br>
                    • Since this is an online conference it’s critical that you have a quality microphone and video camera. Also since we will be LIVE for QA please make sure that you join using a wired internet connection whenever possible.<br>
                    • The perfect video length is 20 minutes for a full talk and 10 Minutes for a short talk. (Check the agenda on RoboCon.io if you are not sure what length your talk has.)<br>
                    • Absolute maximum length accepted for a full talk are 25 Minutes.<br>
                    • Absolute maximum length accepted for a short talk are 12 Minutes.<br>
                    • Live Q&A Session will fill up the remaining time to the end of your 30 or 15 Minutes slot.<br><br>
                    The more actionable the session content the better. Our goal is that a RoboCon attendee will learn a tip, tool, technique, or best practice they can implement right away to get results.<br><br>
                  </p>
                  <h3>Recording software Suggestions</h3>
                  <p class="type-body">
                    • For Mac, <a href="http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/">Screenflow</a> is recommended<br>
                    • For PC or Mac the popular is <a href="https://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html">Camtasia</a><br>
                    Some more affordable options would be<br>
                    • <a href="https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html">Snagit</a> and <a href="https://screencast-o-matic.com/home">Screencast-O-Matic</a> or <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/quicktime-player/qtp97b08e666/mac">Quicktime Player</a><br>
                    • <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a><br><br>
                    Speakers are expected to have a quality microphone and video cam (*These are just suggestions. You can use what you have but if you don’t have anything yet here are some suggestions. Since I want to present guild speakers in the best possible light I think it’s critical that you have good audio and video quality)<br><br>

                    <h3>Video Cameras for Recording</h3>
                  <p class="type-body">
                    You may also use your webcams for recording, but often your SmartPhone (Android or iPhone) has a much higher Quality. Use the real camera on the backside of your phone.
                    If you have a DSLR or DSLM photo camera that can record video, this might be the best option. These recorded videos maybe put together in post production.
