1. Robot Framework Ry legitimate interests as processing of Customer Contact Data is an obligatory enabler for conducting business activities in compliance with any applicable laws;
2. Contractual relationships either directly with the data subjects or indirectly with the Customers that the data subjects represent; and/or
3. Consent received from the data subject for processing of Customer Contact Data belonging to special categories (cf. section "Customer Contact Data Content (Data Attributes and Information)" below).

The data subject may at any time withdraw the consent to which the processing of Customer Contact Data is based on.

## Customer Contact Data Content (Data Attributes and Information):

Identification and general contact data attributes such as:
* Name;
* Mailing address;
* Email address;
* Telephone numbers;

Information concerning allergies or dietary requirements and expectations for organizing refreshments and catering e.g. in customer meetings, receptions and trainings (this information may contain health information and is therefore special category personal data and can be collected and processed with the consent of the data subject only);

Information related to Customer Companies such as:
* Customer Company name;
* Position and/or title within Customer Company

Information necessary for invoicing and execution of other financial transactions related to Customer Companies and customer contact persons;

## Sources of Customer Contact Data:

## Disclosures and Transfers of Customer Contact Data and Transfer of Customer Contact Data to countries outside European Union or the European Economic Area:

Customer Contact Data are not generally disclosed (to another controller for independent use) unless required by the mandatory law such as to authorities.

If Customer Contact Data is transferred to/from external data processors (subcontractors or vendors) to be processed on behalf of Robot Framework Ry, appropriate data processing agreements, as required by the applicable laws, are executed to secure lawful and appropriate processing of Customer Contact Data.

Customer Contact Data may due to necessary technical and practical processing requirements be transferred outside EU and/or EEA (incl. Switzerland). Should such international transfer occur, it would only be executed as allowed by and in accordance with applicable laws. Due to small coverage of EU Commission adequacy decisions, EU Commission standard contractual clauses (e.g. of type controller to processor, EU Commission decision 2010/87/EU) would be typically used as appropriate safeguards for these international personal data transfers. In some cases, also US/EU Privacy Shield arrangement would be relied on. Copies of the standard contractual clauses would be available through the contact details mentioned above.

Customer Contact Data can be transferred from Finland to the following countries for processing:
* All European Union member states;
* United States of America;
 

## Security Principles of the Data File:
Customer Contact Data is protected by organisational and technical measures against accidental and/or unlawful access, alteration, and destruction or other processing including unauthorized disclosure and transfer of Customer Contact Data.

## Retention period of Customer Contact Data:

This general retention rule is based on i.a. laws regulating expiration of debts. Also, possible needs related to litigation purposes justify such retention of the Customer Contact Data.

However, the above retention rule is always subject to differing requirements included in any mandatory laws applicable to Customer Contact Data. Therefore, in some cases, retention period may be shorter or longer than the above-mentioned.

Notwithstanding the above, the retention of Customer Contact Data may always be extended due to existing or imminent need of any company belonging to Robot Framework Ry to establish or exercise legal claims or defend itself against legal claims related to Customer Contact Data.
